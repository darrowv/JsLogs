# Online JS Code Console

### [Try it out](https://darrowv.github.io/JsLogs/)

## Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Dark and light themes
- Some codemirror features as brackets closing, match highlighting etc.
- Minimalistic design, just your js code input and console output
- Run and clear console buttons (or run on "ctrl + enter" and clear on "ctrt + \")

## Tips
- You can also use the keyboard shortcuts to run the code (Ctrl+Enter) and to clear console output (Ctrl + \\)
- You can change the theme of the editor by clicking on (initially) the moon.

## Contribution
We welcome contributions from the community to improve the editor. You can fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
Currently we have next issues:
- Issue with asynchronous code output.
- Resize div "jumps" when is dragged.
